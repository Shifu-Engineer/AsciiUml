## Help wanted
This is a fun project. While simple on the outside, there are some advanced things going on under the hood. It would be cool to form a community around the tool and help make it more mature. I certainly have plenty of ideas for ways of improving it :-)

If you want to help out just raise an issue here on github.
  
## NOTICE

The state of the project currently is more a playground for trying out some functional C# rather than a mature product
